  abstract = {Many stochastic simulation approaches for generating observations from a posterior distribution depend on knowing a likelihood function. However, for many complex probability models, such likelihoods are either impossible or computationally prohibitive to obtain. Here we present a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for generating observations from a posterior distribution without the use of likelihoods. It can also be used in frequentist applications, in particular for maximum-likelihood estimation. The approach is illustrated by an example of ancestral inference in population genetics. A number of open problems are highlighted in the discussion.},

  abstract = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However, microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor: the 95\% interval runs from \textasciitilde{}15,000 to 130,000 years, with most likely values around 30,000 years.},

  abstract = {Abstract Inferring the history of isolation and gene flow during species differentiation can inform us on the processes underlying their formation. Following their recent expansion in Europe, two subspecies of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus) have formed a hybrid zone maintained by hybrid incompatibilities and possibly behavioural reinforcement, offering a good model of incipient speciation. We reconstruct the history of their divergence using an approximate Bayesian computation framework and sequence variation at 57 autosomal loci. We find support for a long isolation period preceding the advent of gene flow around 200?000 generations ago, much before the formation of the European hybrid zone a few thousand years ago. The duration of the allopatric episode appears long enough (74\% of divergence time) to explain the accumulation of many post-zygotic incompatibilities expressed in the present hybrid zone. The ancient contact inferred could have played a role in mating behaviour divergence and laid the ground for further reinforcement. We suggest that both subspecies originally colonized the Middle East from the northern Indian subcontinent, domesticus settling on the shores of the Persian Gulf and musculus on those of the Caspian Sea. Range expansions during interglacials would have induced secondary contacts, presumably in Iran, where they must have also interacted with Mus musculus castaneus. Future studies should incorporate this possibility, and we point to Iran and its surroundings as a hot spot for house mouse diversity and speciation studies.},

We find that two-phase models do not lead to a significantly better fit than their one-phase counterparts. The performance of models based on the fit of their stationary distributions to the empirical distribution of microsatellite lengths in the human genome is consistent with that based on the human-chimp comparison. Microsatellites interrupted by even a single point mutation exhibit a twofold decrease in their mutation rate when compared to pure AC repeats. In general, models that allow chimps to have a larger per-repeat unit slippage rate and/or a shorter focal length compared to humans give a better fit to the human-chimp data as well as the human genomic data.},

Greater African diversity is most apparent at loci with smaller overall variance in allele size, suggesting that the record of population history has been erased at repeat loci with higher mutation rates. A power analysis shows that only 35\textendash{}40 microsatellites are needed to establish this difference statistically, demonstrating the considerable evolutionary information contained in these systems. On average, African populations have $\approx$20\% greater microsatellite diversity than do Asian and European populations.

The repeat sequences can be widely dispersed or in simple tandem arrays. Arrays of up to 5 or 6 nt are known as simple tandem repeats, and these are widely dispersed and highly polymorphic. Members of one group of the simple tandem repeats, the trinucleotide repeats, can undergo an increase in copy number by a process of dynamic mutation. Dynamic mutations of the CCG trinucleotide give rise to one group of fragile sites on human chromosomes, the rare folate-sensitive group. One member of this group, the fragile X (FRAXA) is responsible for the most common familial form of mental retardation. Another member of the group FRAXE is responsible for a rarer mild form of mental retardation. Similar mutations of AGC repeats give rise to a number of neurological disorders. The expanded repeats are unstable between generations and somatically. The intergenerational instability gives rise to unusual patterns of inheritance--particularly anticipation, the increasing severity and/or earlier age of onset of the disorder in successive generations. Dynamic mutations have been found only in the human species, and possible reasons for this are considered. The mechanism of dynamic mutation is discussed, and a number of observations of simple tandem repeat mutation that could assist in understanding this phenomenon are commented on.},

Historically, tandem repeats have been designated as non functional ``junk'' DNA, mostly as a result of their highly unstable nature. With the exception of tandem repeats involved in human neurodegenerative diseases, repeat variation was often believed to be neutral with no phenotypic consequences. Recent studies, however, have shown that as many as 10\% to 20\% of coding and regulatory sequences in eukaryotes contain an unstable repeat tract. Contrary to initial suggestions, tandem repeat variation can have useful phenotypic consequences. Examples include rapid variation in microbial cell surface, tuning of internal molecular clocks in flies and the dynamic morphological plasticity in mammals. As such, tandem repeats can be useful functional elements that facilitate evolvability and rapid adaptation.},

Both exact distributions of coalescence times and ancestral lineage numbers are expressed as the sum of alternating series, and the terms in the series become numerically intractable for large samples. More computationally attractive are their asymptotic distributions, which were derived in Griffiths (1984) for populations with constant size. In this article, we derive the asymptotic distributions of coalescence times and ancestral lineage numbers for populations with temporally varying size. For a sample of size n, denote by Tm the mth coalescent time, when m + 1 lineages coalesce into m lineages, and An(t) the number of ancestral lineages at time t back from the current generation. Similar to the results in Griffiths (1984), the number of ancestral lineages, An(t), and the coalescence times, Tm, are asymptotically normal, with the mean and variance of these distributions depending on the population size function, N(t). At the very early stage of the coalescent, when t $\rightarrow$ 0, the number of coalesced lineages n - An(t) follows a Poisson distribution, and as m $\rightarrow$ n, n(n-1)Tm/2N(0)n(n-1)Tm/2N(0)$<$mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="me1" overflow="scroll"$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mi$>$n$<$/mml:mi$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mo$>$($<$/mml:mo$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mi$>$n$<$/mml:mi$><$mml:mo$>$-$<$/mml:mo$><$mml:mn$>$1$<$/mml:mn$><$/mml:mrow$><$mml:mo$>$)$<$/mml:mo$><$/mml:mrow$><$mml:msub$><$mml:mi$>$T$<$/mml:mi$><$mml:mi$>$m$<$/mml:mi$><$/mml:msub$><$/mml:mrow$><$mml:mo$>$/$<$/mml:mo$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mn$>$2$<$/mml:mn$><$mml:mi$>$N$<$/mml:mi$><$mml:mrow$><$mml:mo$>$($<$/mml:mo$><$mml:mn$>$0$<$/mml:mn$><$mml:mo$>$)$<$/mml:mo$><$/mml:mrow$><$/mml:mrow$><$/mml:mrow$><$/mml:mrow$><$/mml:math$>$ follows a gamma distribution.

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and has long been recognized to occur in familial clusters. Brothers and sons of affected men have a 2\textendash{}3-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer. However, identification of genetic susceptibility loci for prostate cancer has been extremely difficult. Although the suggestion of linkage has been reported for many chromosomes, the most promising regions have been difficult to replicate. In this study, we compare genome linkage scans using microsatellites with those using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), performed in 467 men with prostate cancer from 167 families. For the microsatellites, the ABI Prism Linkage Mapping Set version 2, with 402 microsatellite markers, was used, and, for the SNPs, the Early Access Affymetrix Mapping 10K array was used. Our results show that the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs can lead to inflated LOD scores, and this seems to be an artifact due to the assumption of linkage equilibrium that is required by the current genetic-linkage software. After excluding SNPs with high LD, we found a number of new LOD-score peaks with values of at least 2.0 that were not found by the microsatellite markers: chromosome 8, with a maximum model-free LOD score of 2.2; chromosome 2, with a LOD score of 2.1; chromosome 6, with a LOD score of 4.2; and chromosome 12, with a LOD score of 3.9. The LOD scores for chromosomes 6 and 12 are difficult to interpret, because they occurred only at the extreme ends of the chromosomes. The greatest gain provided by the SNP markers was a large increase in the linkage information content, with an average information content of 61\% for the SNPs, versus an average of 41\% for the microsatellite markers. The strengths and weaknesses of microsatellite versus SNP markers are illustrated by the results of our genome linkage scans.},

Because of their polymorphisms and high mutation rates, STRs are widely used in biological research. Strand-slippage replication is the predominant mutation mechanism of STRs, and the stepwise mutation model is regarded as the main mutation model. STR mutation rates can be influenced by many factors. Moreover, some trinucleotide repeats are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases. In order to deepen our knowledge of these diseases and broaden STR application, it is essential to understand the STR mutation process in detail.

Based on their power of discrimination, use in deciphering mixture components, and ability to be combined in multiplex assays in order to recover information from low amounts of biological material, we believe that STRs rather than SNPs will fulfill the dominant role in human identity testing for the foreseeable future.

  abstract = {Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in complex genomes are poorly understood. We examined these processes by introducing a two-phase mutation model. In this model, most mutations are single-step changes, but infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used computer simulations to determine expected values of statistics that reflect frequency distributions of allele size for the two-phase model and two alternatives, the one-step and geometric models. The theoretical expectations for each model were tested by comparison with observed values for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian population, whose genetic and demographic histories have been previously reconstructed. The two-phase model provided the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were neutral and that this population had undergone rapid population growth. Recent observations made for unstable trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that frequent small changes and rare large changes in repeat number represent two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We genotyped the same 10 loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan African samples to assess the utility of SSRs for studying the divergence of populations and found that estimates of interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those derived from analysis of mitochondrial DNA.},

Here, we introduce an elaboration of their model that keeps track of all parts of a perfect repeat and a simplification that ignores point mutations. We develop a detailed mathematical theory for these models that exhibits properties of microsatellite distributions, such as positive skewness of allele lengths, that are consistent with data but are inconsistent with the predictions of the stepwise mutation model. We use our theoretical results to analyze the successes and failures of the genetic distances ($\delta\mu$)2 and DSW when used to date four divergences: African vs. non-African human populations, humans vs. chimpanzees, Drosophila melanogaster vs. D. simulans, and sheep vs. cattle. The influence of point mutations explains some of the problems with the last two examples, as does the fact that these genetic distances have large stochastic variance. However, we find that these two features are not enough to explain the problems of dating the human-chimpanzee split. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that long microsatellites have a mutational bias that favors contractions over expansions.},

We show that it is possible to synthesize all types of repetitious di- and trinucleotide motifs starting from short primers and a polymerase in vitro. The rate of this synthesis depends on a sequence specific slippage rate, but is independent of the length of the fragments being synthesized. This indicates that only the ends of the DNA fragments are involved in determining this rate and that slippage is accordingly a short range effect. Slippage synthesis occurs also on a fixed template where only one strand is free to move, a situation which resembles chromosome replication in vivo. It seems therefore likely that slippage during replication is the cause of the observed length polymorphism of simple sequence stretches between individuals of a population.},

Seeing the huge potential of SNPs in pharmacogenomics and crop genetics, various assays for their genotyping have been described, which include direct sequencing, mining from EST databases, cleavage assays, molecular beacons, etc. Each of these assays are having their own merits and demerits and the choice of assay depends on the objective of the study and availability of the resources. These assays utilize detection platforms that range from the conventional gel based detection to high throughput systems like microarrays, mass spectrometry and flow cytometry.

On the basis of analyses of spontaneous human microsatellite mutations of germline origin, I show here that different mutation biases underlie the evolution of microsatellite repeats. The within-locus mutation rate increases with allele length, but is not affected by the size difference between an individual's two alleles (allele span). Within loci, long alleles tend to mutate to shorter lengths, thereby acting to prevent infinite growth. Expansions are more common than contractions among dinucleotide repeats, whereas no such trend is evident among tetranucleotide repeats. This observation is consistent with the longer repeat lengths and higher frequency of di- compared with tetranucleotide repeats. An excess of paternally transmitted mutations (male-to-female ratio of 4.9) supports a male-biased mutation rate in the human genome.},

Despite their high mutability, stable allele frequency distributions are typically observed for microsatellites in humans as well as other primates2,3, although the mechanism maintaining these stable distributions remains unclear. Previous studies have suggested that microsatellite mutations occur more frequently in longer alleles and favour expansion4,5,6,7,8. Generalizing these results has been hindered because the sample sizes were small, only a small subset of alleles for any marker was studied and the direction of mutation (expansion or contraction) was not rigorously determined. Here we examine 236 mutations at 122 tetranucleotide repeat markers and find that the rate of contraction mutations increases exponentially with allele size, whereas the rate of expansion mutations is constant across the entire allele distribution. The overall rate of expansion mutations does not differ from that of contractions. Our findings offer an explanation for the stationary allele distribution of microsatellites.},

Some present-day humans derive up to $\sim$5\% [1] of~their ancestry from archaic Denisovans, an even~larger proportion than the $\sim$2\% from Neanderthals [2]. We developed methods that can disambiguate the locations of segments of Denisovan and Neanderthal ancestry in present-day humans and applied them to 257 high-coverage genomes from 120 diverse populations, among which were 20 individual Oceanians with high Denisovan ancestry [3]. In Oceanians, the average size of Denisovan fragments is larger than Neanderthal fragments, implying a more recent average date of Denisovan admixture in the history of these populations (p~= 0.00004). We document more Denisovan ancestry in South Asia than is expected based on existing models of~history, reflecting a previously undocumented mixture related to archaic humans (p~= 0.0013). Denisovan ancestry, just like Neanderthal ancestry, has been deleterious on a modern human genetic background, as reflected by its depletion near genes. Finally, the reduction of both archaic ancestries is especially pronounced on chromosome X and near genes more highly expressed in testes than other tissues (p~= 1.2~\texttimes{} 10-7 to 3.2~\texttimes{} 10-7 for Denisovan and 2.2~\texttimes{} 10-3 to 2.9~\texttimes{} 10-3 for Neanderthal ancestry even after controlling for differences in level of selective constraint across gene classes). This suggests that reduced male fertility may be a general feature of mixtures of human populations diverged by $>$500,000 years.},

  abstract = {A critical issue for users of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13 convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parametrizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},
