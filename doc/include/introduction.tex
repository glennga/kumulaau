\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Around $200,000$ years ago, modern humans evolved in Africa.
Around $40,000 - 80,000$ years ago, humans migrated out of Africa into Eurasia~\cite{campbellEvolutionHumanGenetic2010}.
In addition to this, modern humans have interbred with other \textit{Homo sapiens}: Neanderthals and
Denisovans~\cite{sankararamanCombinedLandscapeDenisovan2016}.
There are, however several questions to answer about the evolutionary history of modern humans:
``How big was each population at time $t$?''
``Can we get a more accurate date for the migration out of Africa?''
``Are there more species we have admixture with?''
The big question is, ``What is the complete demographic model for modern humans?''

Where did we get our current estimates?
The answer (for the majority) is genetic variation.
We can infer evolutionary history by tracking how DNA sequences vary (or mutate) from generation to generation.
This is done by constructing proposed demographic models, and determining the likelihood of said models.
This paper addresses the first step toward doing so: finding a reasonable evolutionary model for a \emph{single}
population.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
In~\autoref{ch:SNPvsMicrosatellites}, we describe the different measures of genetic variation.
In~\autoref{ch:simulatingEvolution}, we describe how to efficiently simulate a microsatellite sample from a population.
In~\autoref{ch:modelingMutation}, we discuss how we model microsatellite mutation.
In~\autoref{ch:dataForParameterEstimation}, we briefly describe our observed data.
In~\autoref{ch:parameterEstimation}, we discuss our methods for maximum likelihood estimation.
In~\autoref{ch:discussion}, we interpret the parameters we found.
%In~\autoref{ch:conclusion}, we discuss what we plan to do after this project.
