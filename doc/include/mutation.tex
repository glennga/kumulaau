\chapter{Modeling Mutation}\label{ch:modelingMutation}
In this chapter, we discuss mutation and describe our proposed 2-parameter $\theta = \{ d, c\}$ mutation model.

\section{Repeat Unit Change Per Generation}\label{sec:repeatUnitChangePerGeneration}
Mutation refers to a change in DNA sequence.
For this paper, we refer to mutation as a change in the repeat length of some locus for a microsatellite variant.
We are also only discussing mutations that are passed on to the next generation, under the neutral (Wright-Fisher)
assumptions.

The simplest model of microsatellite mutation and evolution is the stepwise mutation
model of Ohta and Kimura~\cite{ohtaModelMutationAppropriate2007}.
Let $f : \mathbb{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{M}$ represent some function that accepts some repeat length and outputs some
repeat length.
Given a population $\pi_t$ at generation $t$ and some repeat length $\ell_t \in \pi_t$, the mutated repeat length
in the next generation $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_{t+1}$ takes three different states:
\begin{equation}
    f(\ell_t) \in \{ \ell_t + 1 , \ell_t, \ell_t - 1\}
\end{equation}
Per generation, each microsatellite variant mutates up one repeat length (expansion), down one repeat length
(contraction), or stays the same -- all with equal probability.

Let $\mu_u$ represent the probability of upward mutation and $\mu_d$ represent the probability of downward mutation.
We can construct our function $f$ as such:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We are given some repeat length $\ell_t$, an upward mutation rate $\mu_u$, and a
        downward mutation rate $\mu_d$.
    \item Sample two numbers from a uniform random distribution: $x_u, x_d \sim U(0, 1)$.
    \item If $\mu_u > x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_t + 1$.
        This is the inverse transform sampling method. \label{enum:um}
    \item If $\mu_d > x_d$ but $\mu_u \leq x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_t - 1$. \label{enum:dm}
        If $\mu_d > x_d \ \land \ \mu_u > x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t)} = \ell_{t}$.
\end{enumerate}

There does exist evidence that mutations occur at steps greater than one repeat length.
A model that takes this into account is the two-phase model, which follows the stepwise mutation model with probability
$p$ and mutates up and down with a length sampled from a geometric distribution, with probability $1-p$
~\cite{dirienzoMutationalProcessesSimplesequence1994}.
This is modeled by the procedure below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We are given some repeat length $\ell_t$, an upward mutation rate $\mu_u$, a
        downward mutation rate $\mu_d$, the probability of the stepwise mutation model $p$, and the success probability
        for the geometric distribution $m$.
    \item Sample three numbers from a uniform random distribution: $x_u, x_d, x_p \sim U(0, 1)$.
    \item If $p > x_p$, then we set the changes in repeat length $\Delta_u = 1, \Delta_d = 1$.
        Otherwise, we sample our changes in repeat length from a geometric distribution:
        $\Delta_u, \Delta_d \sim \mathit{Geom}(m)$.
    \item If $\mu_u > x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_t + \Delta_u$.
    \item If $\mu_d > x_d \land \mu_u \leq x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_t - \Delta_d$.
    \item If $\mu_d > x_d \land \mu_u > x_u$, then $f(\ell_{t}) = \ell_{t} + \Delta_u - \Delta_d$.
\end{enumerate}

The two-phase model is more flexible here, but this introduces two new parameters to estimate: $p$ and $m$.
According to Sainudiin, the likelihood of all ``one phase'' models are
not significantly different than their two phase counterparts~\cite{sainudiinMicrosatelliteMutationModels2004}.
For this reason, our model restricts repeat lengths to mutate by at most one per generation.

    Our focal bias with these parameters is $\hat{\ell}=12$.}\label{fig:mutationModel}
\end{figure}

Before building a more complex model, we must first ask, ``When does mutation occur?''.
Does it occur per generation?
Per every odd generation?
The answer to this lies with a quantity known as $\mu \in [0, 1]$, or the \emph{mutation rate}.
From generation to generation we generate a uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and 1, and ask if this draw
is below our mutation rate.
If the answer is yes, we mutate up or down one repeat length.
Otherwise, our repeat length remains unchanged.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \text{mutate} & \mu > \ \sim U(0, 1) \\
        \text{do not mutate} & \mu \leq \ \sim U(0, 1)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

        \If{$d\ell < \ \sim U(0, 1)$}{
            $\ell_{t+1} \gets \ell_{t+1} - 1$ \;
        }
        \Return $\ell_{t+1}$ \;
    }
    \textbf{end} \;

    To stay consistent with the definition of $f$ we denote $c$ and $d$ as parameters of the model itself.}
    \label{alg:mutateFunction}
\end{algorithm}

An assumption made with stepwise mutation model is that the probability of mutation is equal for all repeat lengths.
Ellegren showed that allele length plays a role in how often mutations
occur~\cite{ellegrenHeterogeneousMutationProcesses2000}.
More specifically, longer repeat lengths mutate more often than shorter repeat lengths.
To introduce this repeat length dependence, we use the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    \mu = s \cdot \ell
\end{equation}
where $s$ represents the strength of this dependence.
There exists evidence for more complex models such as the exponentially increasing mutation rate of Xu et.\ al.\
~\cite{xuDirectionMicrosatelliteMutations2000}.
Following Sainudiin's general model (which included only linear dependence), we made the decision to use the equation
above.

\section{Presence of Mutational Bias}\label{sec:presenceOfMutationalBias}
There now exists a mutation rate dependence on repeat length, but the probability of mutating up or down is still
equally likely.
Garza's proposed that microsatellites mutate toward a \emph{focal
length}~\cite{garzaMicrosatelliteAlleleFrequencies1995}.
If the repeat length of interest $\ell$ is below the focal length at some generation $t$, $\ell$ will have a higher
probability of mutating upward than downward in the following generations.
Conversely, if $\ell$ is above the focal length at some generation $t$, $\ell$ will have a higher probability of
mutating downward than upward in the following generations.

Sainudiin's general model uses the functions $\beta : \ell, s \mapsto [0, 1]$ and $\alpha : u, v, \ell \mapsto [0, 1]$:
\begin{align}
    \beta(\ell, s) &= \mu (1 + (\ell - \kappa)s) \\
    \alpha(u, v, \ell) &= \text{max} (0, \text{min}(1, u - v(\ell - \kappa)))
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the rate of mutation and $\alpha$ is probability that our repeat length is incremented (expanded).
Here, $s$ determines the strength of length dependence for mutation rate, $u$ represents some constant bias applied
toward expansion, and $v$ represents the linear bias toward expansion.
A focal length $\hat{\ell} = ((u - 0.5) / v)$ is specified if we have a greater tendency toward
expansion at lower repeat lengths ($0.5 < u < 1$) and if the following holds:
$(u - 0.5) / (\Omega - \kappa) < v < \infty$~\cite{sainudiinMicrosatelliteMutationModels2004}.
In other words, a focal length is defined where the probability of expansion equals the probability of contraction.

\section{Proposed Mutation Model}\label{sec:proposedMutationModel}
This now brings us to our complete mutation model.
To introduce a bias toward some focal length, we define two mutation rates: the upward mutation rate $\mu_u$ and the
downward mutation rate $\mu_d$.
The total mutation rate is the sum of the two $\mu = \mu_u + \mu_d$.
We define $\mu_d$ to be dependent on repeat length, and $\mu_u$ to be constant:
\begin{align}
    \mu_u &= c \\
    \mu_d &= d\ell
\end{align}
where $c$ represents a constant bias for the upward mutation (or, the upward mutation rate itself) and $d$ represents a
linear bias for the downward mutation rate.
We constrain $c > 0$ and $d \geq 0$ to ensure that mutation is always occuring.
The focal length $\hat{\ell}$ is defined as the intersection between the upward and downward mutation rate:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\ell} = \frac{c}{d}
\end{equation}
This differs from Sainudiin's model usage of $\alpha(u, v, \ell)$, but for our purposes is functionally equivalent and
requires two less parameters.

In addition to the three requirements listed in the previous sections, we constrain that any individuals having repeat
length $\ell = \kappa$ are unable to mutate back up.
If $f$ is given some repeat length $\ell$ equal to the lower bound of $\mathbb{M}$, $\ell$ is returned.
This is meant to simulate how microsatellites are sometimes lost:

Graphically, this is represented in~\autoref{fig:mutationModel}.
We describe the entire mutation function $f$ in~\autoref{alg:mutateFunction}.
