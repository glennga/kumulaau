\section{Future Work}\label{sec:fw}
Determining the mutation model parameters is the first step toward determining the parameters of a more complex model:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A three population model: Ancestors, African vs.\ Non African.
        We can determine the population sizes of all populations, the time of the African and Non African split, and
        any other associated parameters.
    \item A five population model: Ancestors, African One, African Two, Non African One, Non African Two.
        We can determine the admixture between the African and Non African populations, as well as the time associated
        with split.
    \item A five population model: \ldots where no splits occur.
        We can focus on the population sizes here.
\end{enumerate}
